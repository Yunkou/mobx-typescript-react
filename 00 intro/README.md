# Introduction to React Mobx TypeScript course

> Developing logic rich applications is becoming more and more common nowadays. The TypeScript-React combination enables a great developer experience in terms of writing understandable and refactorable HTML. However the default state mangement for React leaves much to be desired in terms of *simplicity* and *maintainabiliy*. MobX can great enhance your state management developer experience as we cover in this course.

> In this course the idea we use again and again is that you can use simple JavaScript classes and enable them as the beating logical heart of your react applications.

We start off covering just a few basic mobx concepts of `observable` `action` and `computed`. Armed with this simple knowledge we look at how 

* you can extract the logic out of your components into well defined state properties and mutations

* Next we cover how you can even encapsulate your complete application logic into a single application state class that gives a cohesive undertanding of the data flow in your application. 

* Then we look at how you can create reuseable state classes and state class driven components for things like user inputs. 

* Finally we even demonstrate how easy it is to test these state classes using any testing framework you want.

> This state class pattern has scaled well in a large number of data rich applications that I have developed with my colleages and I hope you enjoy using it as much as we do.
