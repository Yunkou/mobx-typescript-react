# React with Mobx and TypeScript course introduction

> Developing logic rich applications is becoming more and more common nowadays. The TypeScript-React combination enables a great developer experience in terms of writing understandable and refactorable HTML. However the default state management for React leaves much to be desired in terms of *simplicity* and *maintainability*. MobX can great enhance your state management developer experience as we cover in this course.

* In this course the idea we use again and again, is that you can model your application logic using simple JavaScript classes, and with mobx enable them as the beating heart of your react applications.

* We start off covering just a few basic mobx concepts of `observable` `action` and `computed`. Armed with this simple knowledge we look at how 

* you can extract the logic out of your components into well defined state properties and mutations

* Next we cover how you can even use this pattern to encapsulate your complete application logic into a single application state class that gives a cohesive undertanding of the data flow for your whole application. 

* Then we look at how you can create reuseable state class driven components that work well with application classes for things like user inputs. 

* Finally we even demonstrate how easy it is to test these state classes. Because mobx is transparent reactive all you need to do is test your JavaScript classes using well knows testing patterns and strategies.

> This state class pattern has scaled well in a large number of data rich applications that I have developed with my colleages and I hope you enjoy using it as much as we do. Thank you.
