# Testing Mobx Applications

>  MobX is independent of React and really you can use whatever testing framework you want with it. Testing MobX is essentially as easy as testing simple JavaScript functions. This lesson demonstrates an example with Jest.

***start off with the items list application 04stateClasses***
Here we have a simple application state class from a previous lesson. 

***show jest.config.js***
We also have jest setup using the standard TypeScript jest process that is covered in a seperate lesson. 

Lets add a test for the file 
Run the test 

## TODO

***Select the whole test file***
You can see that the fact that mobx is transparent reactive you get to write simple JavaScript classes for your state and test it without having to go through complex apis and patterns.
