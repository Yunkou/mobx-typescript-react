# Using mobx to isolate a React component state

> React is great for diffing between Virtual-DOM and rendering it to the dom. It also offers a na√Øve solution for diffing state in terms of `setState`. However it is slightly verbose and not easy to scale. MobX offers a very simple and effective solution to manage state in React components.

Lets kickoff with a simple react-typescript application.
* We have a `Hello` component that maintains a local `clickedCount` state.
* We initialize this state in the constructor,
* Have a function that increments this using react's setState
* And finally render a button that increments this count on click and shows the current clickedCount as its content.
* We go ahead and render this component into the root of our page.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class Hello extends React.Component<{}, { clickedCount: number }> {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      clickedCount: 0
    };
  }
  increment() {
    this.setState({
      clickedCount: this.state.clickedCount + 1
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.increment()}>
        Click count = {this.state.clickedCount}
      </button>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Hello />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

```
***Demo react click the button a few times***
* As we click the button the click count is incremented and the ui updates accordingly.

***Open up shell***
Using mobx in a react application is super easy. All we need to do is install `mobx` along with `mobx-react`.

```sh
npm install mobx mobx-react
```
Since mobx is written in TypeScript there is no additional setup or type definitions required.

***Jump back to code***
* `mobx` provides decorators `observable` to mark a property as observable and `action` to carry out mutations in a transactional manner.
* `mobx-react` provides a decorator `observer` that can warp a react component to make it reactive to observable changes.

```js
import { observable, action } from 'mobx';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react';
```
These three simple decorators are pretty much all you need to be highly productive with mobx.

* Using mobx we isolate the state management for the Hello component into a simple `HelloData` class.
* It contains a simple `clickedCount` observable property.
* And an `increment` action that increments this clicked count property using easy to understand and maintain JavaScript.

```js
class HelloData {
  @observable clickedCount = 0;

  @action
  increment() {
    this.clickedCount++;
  }
}
```

To use this data class in react component we simply decorate the component as an `@observer`
* Since we are no longer using ReactState, we remove its generic annotation.
* We simply initialize the data whenever the component is initiated.
* And then use this data member in our render function, to interact with the state.

```js
@observer
class Hello extends React.Component<{}> {
  data = new HelloData();
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.data.increment()}>
        Click count = {this.data.clickedCount}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

***Run the demo***
If we run the demo you can see that it works same as before.

***Select the data class***
* Moving this data management out of the React component means it is completely independent of react. And all data management becomes simple JavaScript that can be tested and reasoned about in isolation independent of DOM representation.

***Select the component***
* Using `mobx` effectively turns react into a simple and effective `data -to-> dom` transform.
